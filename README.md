# CMPSC 473 - Lab #1 - Instructions
Read carefully the PDF `lab1_473_spring19.pdf`, it contains all the questions you will have to answer for this lab.

To answer the questions, fill out the `answers.py` script present in this repo. Make sure to only fill out your answers in the designated area (i.e. not in the initial declaration of the answers variables).

Remember to add you PSU ID (e.g. xyz1234) in the dedicated variable.

Once you think you have answered every question, run the script with the command

    python answers.py

If you you do not get any error message, it means that your answers are all of the right type (not necessarily that they are correct).

If you do get some error messages, they will tell you which variable has been incorrecly filled out.

The part 4 of this assigment will also require you to modify the source code `prog4.c`. Be sure to include the modified version in your commits, otherwise we will not be able to grade it.

All the program executions are to be performed on the CSE lab machines (`cse-p204instxx.cse.psu.edu`), for consistency purposes. If you have issues with logging into these machines, contact the TAs or instructor for help.
